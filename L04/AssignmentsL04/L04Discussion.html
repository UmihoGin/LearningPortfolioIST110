    <p>Reflective statement: I went into too much detail for this assignment and write a very detailed post. This was when I was doing some personal PC modifications so all of this was on the top of my head as it is one of my hobbies.</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a discussion post about exploring comuter hardware</p>
    <p>My rational: Use what I already know and write about it</p>
