    <p>Reflective statement: I got to learn about the specific layout of out of date consoles and how unique the parts were for even the old xbox's</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Do a breakdown of different core computer parts in other devices</p>
    <p>My rational: Chose hardware that I have used before and learn more about it, and how unique the parts were for it</p>
