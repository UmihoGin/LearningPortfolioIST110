    <p>Reflective statement: I relearned overly simplifed information about what I already knew in a lot of detail</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Read about computer hardware</p>
    <p>My rational: read through the zybook pages about computer hardware and grumble to myself that I already knew it in a lot more detail then necessary</p>
