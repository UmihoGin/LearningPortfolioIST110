    <p>Reflective statement: I did not learn anything from this section at all, but I hope for the few that read my post I could be of use to them</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a discussion post about different programming languages and their levels</p>
    <p>My rational: Pick the simple points and write about them in detail</p>
