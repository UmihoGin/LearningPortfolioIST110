    <p>Reflective statement: I learned why Pandora did not remain relvant in the modern day world of music</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Listen to some Pandora and write a report based on the questions</p>
    <p>My rational: I went in and picked a common music category that Pandora should have done well. (it did not do good)</p>
