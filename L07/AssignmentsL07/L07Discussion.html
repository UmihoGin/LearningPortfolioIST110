    <p>Reflective statement: I reviewed the macros I learned overtime from my job then wrote a report about it for others to read about</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Make a discussion post about macros</p>
    <p>My rational: I wanted to chose useful macros that not many students would already know about</p>
