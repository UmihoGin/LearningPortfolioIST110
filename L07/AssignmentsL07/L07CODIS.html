    <p>Reflective statement: I got to learn about how CODIS is used for the FBI and read about how it helps to match people</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Learn about CODIS and how it works, then make a write up about it</p>
    <p>My rational: I went into this one thinking I already knew about it, because that has been a lot of what IST 110 has been. Then realize there is a lot more I could learn about CODIS</p>
