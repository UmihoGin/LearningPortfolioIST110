    <p>Reflective statement: I learned a tiny bit about the differences in the internet and web, but mostly I already knew about it</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Make a discussion post about the internet and web</p>
    <p>My rational: I wrote about the differences of the internet and web, and the global impacts of it</p>
