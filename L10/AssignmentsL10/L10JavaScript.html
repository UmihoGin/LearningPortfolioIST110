    <p>Reflective statement: I again did not learn anything new as I ready took classes on Javascript on CodeAcademy</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Go to the designed website and write some javescript</p>
    <p>My rational: follow instructions and made sure to include the proper documentation</p>
