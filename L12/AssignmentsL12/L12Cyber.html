    <p>Reflective statement: I formed the opinion juveniles need to be punished equaly for cybercrime</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a short essay about one of the topics (I chose Whether juveniles should or shouldn't be punished the same as adults for cybercrime; does it depend on what kind of cybercrime if so?)</p>
    <p>My rational: I went to the Penn Libary, next read over some papers, write the essay, and lastly cite my sources</p>
