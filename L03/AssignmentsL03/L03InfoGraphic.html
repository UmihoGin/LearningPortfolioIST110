    <p>Reflective statement: I learned how to use adobe express when making the infographic, then the content was the same from the readings and discussion post from L03</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Make an infographic about computational problem solving concepts</p>
    <p>My rational: I picked one of the topics to talk about and wrote what I deemed to be the most essential points of it</p>
