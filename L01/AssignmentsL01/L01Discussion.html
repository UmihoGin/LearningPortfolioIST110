    <p>Reflective statement: I got to rethink about what my tech weekness are (cybersecurity and backend dev work)</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a post and include discussion points about the online readings, and introducing myself</p>
    <p>My rational: Be as concise as possible as to not waste anytime while completing the activity</p>
