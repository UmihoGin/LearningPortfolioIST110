    <p>Reflective statement: I enjoyed writing a opinionated statement about the negatives of information overloading and how it can occur.</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Go through the Penn state archives and learn about information overloading</p>
    <p>My rational: Resarch throughly and find a few articles that I like, then write a recap and state an opinion an whats it was about</p>
