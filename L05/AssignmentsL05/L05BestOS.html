    <p>Reflective statement: I did some more research in the values of linux and mac that I previously neglected. It was interesting writing a pro and con list of each of the operating systems</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a report based on the three main OS systems and do it from the perspecive of a tech consulting firm</p>
    <p>My rational: Really get down into it and figure out what I would actually do if I was in this position</p>
