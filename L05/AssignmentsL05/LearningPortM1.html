    <p>Reflective statement: I wrote the HTML for all of the pages, and kept the organization stratgy that I intially decided on</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Organize what I am doing for the final project and figure out a baseline to work with</p>
    <p>My rational: I initally wanted to use wordpress, but switched to writing the HTMl for the website because the UI of wordpress was really bad</p>
