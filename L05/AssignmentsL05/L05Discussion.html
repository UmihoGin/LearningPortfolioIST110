    <p>Reflective statement: I did research about what application I wanted to write a note on, and started to realize the similarites between using a centralized hub for all of my pc components as to what apple is already doing</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a discussion post about the different operating systems</p>
    <p>My rational: I chose something that I actually use on a daily basis and really think about why</p>
