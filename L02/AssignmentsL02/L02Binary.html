    <p>Reflective statement: I reapplyed what I already knew about binary and did some conversion practice for it</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Play a binary converting game, do some conversion practice for binary, and make a short write up about binary</p>
    <p>My rational: play the game, then write the write up for what I learned about binary</p>
