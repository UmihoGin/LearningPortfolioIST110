    <p>Reflective statement: The skills I learned from this is how to set up a plan to do an assignemnt? It was however useful setting up what I want to do in advance even though I changed it a bit.</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Setting up an organization guide to how I want to do the final project of IST 110.</p>
    <p>My rational: I went with a quick and direct way to present information.</p>
