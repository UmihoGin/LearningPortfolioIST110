    <p>Reflective statement: I learned some basline information about information science and Technology. I don't think a lot of it was as detailed as I wish as I already knew a lot of it before hand</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Read through the zybook and participate in the activities</p>
    <p>My rational: Going though the assignement 1 section at a time</p>
