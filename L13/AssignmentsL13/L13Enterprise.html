    <p>Reflective statement: I learned more about Toyota as a company and how they have intergrated tech in their company. I also spent time learning about the Mayo Clinic</p>
    <p>The assignment/project is: Write a report in a pre determined format about 3 companies and answer the questions</p>
    <p>My rational: I did some research about 3 different companies to answer what the companys operations, profits, and oranization is. </p>
